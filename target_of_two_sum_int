# Think an array of integers. Return the indices of two integers, such that if we add them up, want to reach to a specific target. 
# There is always one unique solution. 

# For an example, suppose the array is like List = [2,9,8,16], and the target sum is 10. Then it will return indices 0 and 2, as List[0] + List[2] = 10.
